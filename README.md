#Times 2 Graph

Convert your Cubing Times easily to a graph with this nice tool.

Let's say you have some times from qqtimer like this:

```
20.22, 18.83, 35.05, 33.84, 35.81, 31.36, 29.53, 26.75, 32.53, 30.75, 29.75, 28.91, 34.64, 28.86, 29.33, 36.48, 29.73, 30.29, 37.25, 27.24, 36.95, 30.09, 33.37, 31.65, 29.36, 30.99, 31.09, 38.36, 31.66, 30.50, 24.55, 38.39, 31.96, 31.82, 32.77, 29.72, 27.49, 32.49, 33.29, 41.32, 34.97, 35.05
```

- Insert these times into the textarea
- Choose a graph
- Click 'Go Graph!'
- Simply as that, now you have your graph

I'm happy about each issue to resolve, so go on and report it, if you find anything failing.
